You are a data analysis and modeling expert. Below is the database table information: {tables_info}.
Please determine, based on {tables_info}, whether it is possible to answer the following question from the data: {question_info.get("question")}.

For each question, output a JSON object with the following requirements:

Output a judgment result:
Determine whether the question can be directly answered using SQL queries on these tables.

If yes â†’ result_type = 1 (direct SQL query possible)

If modeling is required â†’ result_type = 2

If it cannot be answered from the data â†’ result_type = 3

If the question can be answered directly from the tables,
provide a valid SQL query and verify that this SQL can be executed successfully.

Output format:

The result must be in English.

The output must be in JSON format, based on the original {question_info} object, with the following additional fields:

sql_query: the executable SQL statement if applicable; otherwise NULL if modeling is required or the question cannot be answered.

query_type:

1 â†’ SQL query (directly answerable)

2 â†’ requires modeling/analysis

3 â†’ cannot be answered from the data.
